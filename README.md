School-Management-System

  In a summary this project's purpose is to create a system that is simple and suitable for the needs of instructor-students with this system of schools. 
Using the recommended software and database system will provide the instructors with real-time update capability and access to information. 
It will also enable students to log into this system whenever they want and access information easily. The use of this system by all schools and 
its management from a single center will allow the problems to be solved with a single team.

We divided our project to the 4 main parts. These parts will use their own pages to access information. 
Pages will be Admin Page, Instructor Page, Student Page, Manager Page. Additionally Login and Registration part will be used.

Instructor Part: In this part, the instructor can do all the operations of his-her students. For example, grading exam-homework grades and adding course materials.

Student Part: In this part, the student can see the offered-taken courses and can take action on them. In addition, it can see the files shared by the instructors in the courses.

Manager Part: In this part, the manager can create a course and choose an instructor for this course. In addition, the manager can see the list of added courses.

Admin Part: In this part, the admin can add schools to the system and manage the schools added to the system.
